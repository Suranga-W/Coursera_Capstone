# Car Accident Severity
## Introduction | Bussiness Understanding
Road accident are extremely common around the world. More server road accidents could
end up with single or multiple causalities. According to the TAC (Transport Accident
Commission) in Victoria, average of 250 loss their lives due to accident in every year. Also,
these accidents lead to lots of property losses. There are many reasons for these accidents,
but it would be great to be understand what the most common causes, in order to prevent
them from happening. For this analysis, I am attempting to build a machine learning model
to predict what are the common reasons for severe accidents in Victoria, Australia. Different
features such as road conditions, weather, light conditions, number of passengers etc are fed
into the model to see what are the most corelating feature for severe accidents. In future,
depending on the feature status, model can be trained to predict and warn drivers a
possibility of a crash. 
## DATA
The data set is taken from Data.Vic which is the place to discover and access Victorian
government open data. Crash Stats data is provided to user by VicRoads for the purpose of
supplying information about road crashes in Victoria for education purposes. This is an
extensive data with over 14 years from 2006 to 2020 over 200,000 observation across
Victoria. There are many files with different features. Before dive deep into the data, all the
features were consolidated to one file.
