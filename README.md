# Car Accident Severity
## Introduction | Bussiness Understanding
To reduce the the frequency and amount of the car accident in Melbourne in a community, Machine Learning algorithms to be developed to predict the severity of a accident based on the past data. Varies attributes such as road condition, weather, light condition etc  in  the dataset to be used to train and predict severity of the crash. Depending on the conditons ( attributes ) of a certain time, model can be trained to predict and warn drivers a possiblity of a crash.
## DATA
This is an extensive data set from the VicRoad Australia, with over 200,000 observations collected over the last 14+ years. To accurately build a model to prevent future accidents and/or reduce their severity, we will use the following attributes â€” ADDRTYPE, WEATHER, ROADCOND, VEHCOUNT, PERSONCOUN etc
